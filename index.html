		<p id="about-content"><b>Dolphins</b> are the aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetaceans. Dolphins weight and size is depend upon different species. Various Species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males are large than females. Some dolphins can travel at speeds of 29 kilometers per hour or leap about 30 feet. They have well developed hearing which is adapted for both water and air. There hearing ability is so good some of them can survive even if they are blind. Some species are very good diving skills to go greater depth of sea. Dolphins are found all over the world, most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic Zones and some dolphins like right whale dolphins prefer colder climates. Dolphins are very intelligent animal. It has habits like learn, cooperate, ability to think like humans and it teach a lot to humans also. Dolphin’s brain size is considered as a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Self-awareness is also seen by some scientist in the specie. Self-awareness is not well-defined scientifically, it is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning that is typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans possess self-awareness among other. In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin’s self-awareness. They showed a video of themselves and another dolphins to the dolphin and recorded the footage. They found out from this experiment that the dolphins has self-awareness rather than social behavior. Dolphin have long played a role in human’s life. In Greek myths, dolphins were seen invariable as helpers of mankind. </p>

		<h1>Prey & Predators</h1>
		<p id="preyPredator-content">Dolphins have very high fat content which makes them excellent source of nutrition for predators. However, dolphin are more trouble than it’s worth most predator like to avoid it pod including sharks. Dolphins protect the weak members of the pod, and aggressively attack anything that approaches in a threatening manner and they can kill the sharks. Orcas and large sharks dispute the title of the most dangerous predator of dolphins, their main reason is natural need to feed on meat that make dolphins more attractive.  

		As to many more species the most dangerous threat to dolphins is human. Some people kills them for the food, others kills it not because it is source of the food they kills the dolphins because they prey on the same fish species than humans. In some countries, people cetaceans, including dolphins. In Japan, the meat of some species is seen as a delicacy.     
		
		All species of the dolphin are carnivores, eating fish and squid. Different species of dolphin focus on different foods and they have variety of hunting styles. Some eat crustaceans like lobsters, shrimps and crabs while some eat octopus and cuttlefish. </p>
